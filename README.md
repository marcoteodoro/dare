## store blocklist for videos
https://github.com/marcoteodoro/dare/blob/ed987c5296ce6ee92e7a4de542db593505657eb1/Dare_Full_Stack.Core/Services/UmbracoPlayListService.cs#L22
this is not complete, I've followed an approach using the blocklist, never used the contentservice to store blocklist information and just now realized a lot more work i needed
to convert the json update it and store it back.

## frontend work
I've followed an hibrid approach as using the vuejs with cdn instead of creating the api to get data and a nodejs / vue project. I've used https://vuetifyjs.com/en/ vuetify 
to speed up this prototype but a real solution and depending on the team skills i would probably use a headless approach creating one api to get the components and the corresponding models for the components.

## css - no work done at all. just the default styles from https://vuetifyjs.com/en/

#NOTE

as a final note, I'm mainly a backend dev, however I'm confortable writing javascipt code, mainly for logic and service/api's interection, but markup and stylling is not someting i'm confortable with. Can do but not my main skil.
